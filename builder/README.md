# Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern thatâ€™s used to encapsulate the construction logic for an object. It is often used when the construction process of an object is complex. The patterns is well suited for constructing different representations of the same class. In this example I create a Message builder that need header, body, and footer to send message.
